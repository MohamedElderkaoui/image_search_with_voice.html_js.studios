000The `readme.md` file you provided seems to contain HTML and JavaScript code for a web application that allows users to search for images using either text input or voice input. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

### HTML Structure:

*   The HTML structure defines a form with an input field for text input and a submit button. Additionally, there's a button for voice input.
*   There's a `<div>` element with an id of `lisdos_out`, which presumably is used to display the search results.

### JavaScript Functionality:

1.  **Event Listeners:**
    
    *   An event listener is added to the submit button to trigger a function when clicked. This function prevents the default form submission behavior, clears the previous search results, and calls the `searchImages()` function with the value entered in the text input.
    *   Another event listener is added to the voice button to trigger voice input functionality.
2.  **Search Functionality:**
    
    *   The `searchImages()` function constructs a URL with the Google Custom Search API endpoint, including the API key and search engine ID. It fetches the search results based on the provided query and appends the images to the `lisdos_out` div.
    *   If no results are found, an error message is logged to the console.
3.  **Voice Search Functionality:**
    
    *   Clicking on the voice button initiates speech synthesis to prompt the user to speak for image search.
    *   Speech recognition is started, and when the user finishes speaking, the recognized speech is appended to the text input field, and the `searchImages()` function is called with the spoken text.
    *   Error handling for speech recognition errors is included.
    *   The recognition is stopped after the user finishes speaking or after a certain amount of time.

### Notes:

*   Ensure to replace the `apiKey` and `searchEngineId` variables with your own API key and search engine ID from Google Custom Search.
*   This code seems to be designed to work with Spanish language (`'es'`), as indicated by the language settings for both speech synthesis and recognition.

Overall, this code creates a simple image search interface that allows users to search using either text input or voice input.
